                            Local state. Global state. Server state. URL state.
                            We can use URL to store some data e.g.

                            The id of the current item, being viewed
                            Filter parameters
                            Pagination offset and limit
                            Sorting data
                            Keeping such data in the URL allows users to share deep links with others.

                            It is recommended to avoid storing such information in the appâ€™s state to avoid the URL in our app getting out of sync. The URL should be used as the system of record, Read from it as needed for information related to sorting, pagination, etc. Update the URL as required when the settings change

                            React Router is a great tool to handle routes and manage the params.

It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the Prototype of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object. </h1>

                            <span className='text-2xl text-yellow-100 font-bold'>Answer:</span>Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

                            In SDLC, STLC, V Model, Unit testing is first level of testing done before integration testing. Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. Though, in a practical world due to time crunch or reluctance of developers to tests, QA engineers also do unit testing.

                            <span className='text-2xl text-yellow-100 font-bold'>Answer:</span>Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular and React with respect to their functionality like the use of components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two is an easy option.
